  <h1> Project Overview</h1>
  <p> My team and I discovered there people have found themselves frustrated when walking a grocery store aimlessly to find an item on their list and taking longer than desired. In result, we came up with a mobile app, Happy Grocer. An app that will generate a map based on your ingredients so you wonâ€™t be finding yourself having to walk down an aisle again.</p>

  <!-- Inteview Findings -->

<section class="interviewFindings">
  <h1> Interview Findings</h1>
  <h3> Main Points</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Grocery shopping viewed as a way to get out of the house and back into the community as a results of the pandemic</li>
    <li> In-store grocery shopping ensures that quality meets your expectations, especially for fresh produce</li>
    <li> Control to assess the options and pick out the exact items you want is a key motivatiojn for choosing in store vs. online</li>
    <li> Online shopping appreciated for convenience, but many find the experience unreliable and expensive</li>
  </ul>

<!-- User Insight-->
<section class="UserInsight">
  <div class="statOrange Insight">
  <h1> User Insights </h1>
  <p>
    During 1x1 interviews, we discovered that people prefer going to the grocery store to assess and pick out items they need for themselves but get frustrated when things on their list are out of stock, isles are crowded or difficult to navigate, and checkout lines are long. </p>

<p>Therefore, we believe that people need a way to streamline the grocery shopping process and that we might be able to help if we can minimize the amount of time users spend walking in circles looking for items on their list.</p>

<p>We might do this by developing a mobile app for an interactive shopping list that indicates availability of each item on the list prior to arriving at the store and provides the ideal shopping route based on the location of each item in the store.

    <h4> 30 years of age</h4>
    <h4> Works at a marketing firm 50+ hours a week.</h4>
    <p>
      For eight months, Laurita has been using an 
online grocery service due to her busy schedule. Although it has been convenient in saving time, the negatives of cost, imperfect produce being picked, and not sending the correct brands on many orders have made her rethink how she shops again. </p>

  <p>
    She wants to go back to in-store shopping, but with her busy schedule and the ease of online shopping/delivery, she is wondering if she'll be able to squeeze it into her schedule each week.
